# 4fun-server

4fun-server is, as its name says, the server part of 4fun, a web application created to show how easy is to communicate a client with a nodejs server using a RESTful API and an implementation of WebSockets.

The client for this server is [available here](https://github.com/davidmogar/4fun-client). Take a look ;)
